ClassFinder Began as a school project and was completed after graduation. It was never brought to market out of concern for monetizing a resource owned by the school. ClassFinder is an android app built on top of the network calls made by the official WWU ClassFinder website (https://admin.wwu.edu/pls/wwis/wwsktime.SelClass). This project was developed by Zach Richardson, Nick Mounier, and Ian Fahning.
